    <ol>
        <li>Describe your previous experiences with coding. What classes have you already taken where you were exposed
            to HTML/CSS/JS? What parts of the class resonated with you? What parts were most confusing?</li>

<p>I have taken last semester's Core 1 Interaction class where we covered basic html and css; I was able to explore different format styles and interactions, such as Flexbox.</p>    

        <li>How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in
            this class to help reduce this anxiety?</li>

<p>In the beginning I was intimidated by the unfamiliarity of coding last semester. However, being able to practice or engage in coding more often, I am gradually feeling comfortable with it.</p>

        <li>How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</li>

<p>Since I will most likely follow a design career path, coding would be a major concept in my future works. This is because generations with technology is constantly evolving, where the web is becoming the greater platform. </p>

        <li>What text editor do you prefer to use?</li>
<p>I've only worked with VSC, which is Visual Studio Code.</p>

        <li>Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub.</li>

<p>I was introduced into Github last semester. Thus, I am still new to the whole platform.</p>

        <li>Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this
            relationship. Bonus points for creative analogies.</li>

<p>HTML is the space, whereas CSS and JavaScript 'customises' the space. HTML is a canvas, CSS and Javascript are paintbrushes.</p>

        <li>Using each HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance (remember, there are six levels
            of heading tags, `h1` through `h6`).</li>

<p>It varies by time? But right now:</p>
<h1>Greek Yoghurt</h1>
<h2>Red Bean Mochi, also known as Daifuku</h2>
<h3>Chipotle</h3>
<h4>Lamb shanks</h4>
<h5>Sea Beam</h5>
<h6>Pineapples</h6>

        <li>Create an unordered list ( `ul` ) and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related
            websites. Include a paragraph ( `p` ) on each site describing why it is important to you.</li>

<ul>PaTI, also known as Paju Typography Institute. <a href="http://www.pati.kr/">http://www.pati.kr/</a></ul>
<p>I enjoy minimalism; less is more. It's important to me because it recently was an inspo for my website that i' m currently working on.</p>
<ul> HDU23 LAB. I just like their works; mostly how they work with Chinese characters through a modern contemporary approach.<a href="https://hdu23lab.com/">https://hdu23lab.com/</a></ul>

        <li>Insert an image (`img`) that brings you joy to the page. Make sure the image includes `alt text` that
            describes the image.</li>

<img src="image.png" alt="an illustration from Mr. DoNothing.">

        <li>Insert a video embed into the page (for example, a YouTube or Vimeo embed tag of a video of your choosing).
            You have a few ways you can approach this:
            <!-- <ul>
                <li>Look into the `iframe` tag. Hint: If using a YouTube or Vimeo video, you can copy the embed code from
                    each video’s page.</li>
                <li>Use a `video` tag, though finding the URL of a video can sometimes be tricky – do you best to download,
                    place it in your project folder, then reference its file path</li>
            </ul> -->

        </li>
        <!-- <li>Nest the following series of HTML tags inside each other, where each → represents a new level. Make sure to
            maintain proper indentation.
            <ul>
                <li>`main` → `section` → `div` → `p` → `span`</li>
                <li>No need to fill these tags with any actual content</li>
            </ul>
        </li> -->
        <li>Create an ordered list of the top 5 countries you’d like to visit. Within each country, create another
            ordered list of the top cities you’d like to visit in that country. Maintain proper indentation and make sure
            you nest your ordered lists properly.</li>

<ol>Greece
    <ul>Paros</ul>
    <ul>Athens</ul>
</ol>
<ol>Japan
    <ul>Yamagata</ul>
    <ul>Ichinomiya</ul>
    <ul>Okinawa</ul>
</ol>
<ol>China
    <ul>Yunnan</ul>
    <ul>Sanya</ul>
    <ul>Sichuan</ul>
</ol>
<ol>Korea
    <ul>Jeju Island</ul>
    <ul>Seoul</ul>
    <ul>Busan</ul>
</ol>
<ol>France
    <ul>Nice</ul>
    <ul>Paris</ul>
</ol>
        <li>Use `pre` tags to create a simple [concrete poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_poetry) version
            of a Haiku or other poem you write. The poem should represent how you feel at this moment.
            <ul>
                <li>Hint: `pre` tags respect whitespace, you can add add lots of spaces and line breaks and they will show
                    up like that when you view the web page.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

<p></p>

        <li>Write an HTML comment that is hidden from the browser, but displays in the code.</li>
<!-- <p>I don't know why we are doing this.</p> -->

        <li>Create an unordered list of at least 6 musical artists you like to listen to. Add a class to each list item
            that matches the genre of music of that artist.</li>

<ul class="kpop">
    BigBang
</ul>
<ul class="jpop">
    Vaundy
</ul>
<ul class="c-pop">
    RunZe Zheng
</ul>
<ul class="rnb">
    Frank Ocean
</ul>
<ul class="c-pop">
    No Party For Cao Dong
</ul>
<ul class="jpop">
    Yaosobi
</ul>

        <li>Describe the difference between block, inline-block and inline elements.</li>

<p>In HTML and CSS, elements are categorized based on their display behavior, and three common types are block, inline-block, and inline elements. These distinctions determine how elements are rendered and how they interact with other elements on the page.

    Block Elements:
    
    Display Behavior: Block-level elements typically start on a new line and occupy the full width of their container.
    Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>.
    Layout: These elements create a "block" or a rectangular box in the document flow. They stack vertically, and any content that follows them will appear on a new line.
    Inline Elements:
    
    Display Behavior: Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
    Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>.
    Layout: Inline elements flow within the content and do not create new lines. They appear on the same line as the content around them, and their width is determined by their content.
    Inline-Block Elements:
    
    Display Behavior: Inline-block elements combine aspects of both block and inline elements. They do not start on a new line but can have a specified width and height.
    Examples: <div style="display: inline-block;">, <span style="display: inline-block;">.
    Layout: Similar to inline elements, they do not start on a new line, but they can have dimensions and other block-level properties. This makes them useful for creating elements that need block-level styling while still flowing within the content.</p>

        <!-- <li>Use CSS to style the musical genre classes you added in question 15. Give each genre a color and personality
            using CSS.</li> -->
            
        <!-- <li>Use any CSS knowledge you currently have to style your questionnaire in a unique way. Make sure to update
            the font to something other than the default (use the font-family css property).</li> -->
        <li>In a `script` tag, use the console.log function to write a message to the console (Cmd+Opt+U). Tell me
            something interesting about yourself.</li>
        <li>Add a `button` to your HTML file and make it do something when clicked using JavaScript</li>
    </ol>
    <button class="button"></button>
    <script>
        console.log("hi, i' m Vanessa.")

let button = document.querySelector(".button");
button.addEventListener("click", turnOnLight);

const cursor = document.getElementById('cursor');

document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
  const x = e.clientX - 8; 
  const y = e.clientY - 8; 

  cursor.style.left = x + 'px';
  cursor.style.top = y + 'px';
});

function toggleImage() {
  var image = document.getElementById('image');

  var isVisible = window.getComputedStyle(image).display !== 'none';
  image.style.display = isVisible ? 'none' : 'block';
}

function changeButtonText() {
  var button = document.getElementById('turn off the lights');

    button.textContent = 'turn on the lights';
  } else {
    button.textContent = 'turn off the lights';
  }
